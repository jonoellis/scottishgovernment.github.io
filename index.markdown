summary: These resources have been made available to help deliver clear content and to guide you in building transactional services that will appear on mygov.scot. Some resources will also help you in building your own separate services.
---

The resources available fall into the following 5 areas:

- **Policy**          – a set of principles, supported by evidence, that articulates Scottish Government ambitions;
- **Standards**       – a set of criteria, scoped to a specific program or service, that MUST be implemented, unless a specific dispensation is made;
- **Recommendations** – guidance that SHOULD be implemented where there is a clear benefit and it is cost effective to do so;
- **Services** – what the Scottish Government can offer your public sector organisation;
- **Guidelines**      – additional and supporting material that organisations COULD consider if they lack existing capability in the relevant area.
