## Delivery
The products found in the Delivery phase may follow on from the Digital Strategy & Roadmap.

High-level activities identified during the Strategy phase will often require an outline or full Business Case which DTS are able to support or develop.

People are at the centre of change and the DTS Talent & Recruitment service offers a critical role in the transformation of organisations. When teams are in place, Agile Coaching can offer greater organisational efficiency and effectiveness.

### Business Case

High-level activities identified in a strategy will often require an outline or full Business Case which DTS can support or develop.

Business cases are developed over time. The three key stages are:
 1) Strategic
 2) Outline business case
 3) Full Business Case.


### Talent & Recruitment

We aim to support our customers in recruiting and developing digital talent, by offering a range of products throughout the recruitment lifecycle.

DTS is able to offer clients experience of central government recruitment and procurement frameworks. DTS has access to quick and accurate procurement and Scottish Government HR Subject Matter Experts (SME).

DTS can also offer specialist digital experience by working with SMEs  across the Scottish Government’s digital directorate. Benefits include:

### Service Design

Embedding user focussed service design needs a strategic approach across the organisation. The Scottish Approach to Service Design Champions Programme is taken by a group of staff who represent key areas and grades within your organisation.

This can be done by people working within digital areas or not. Digital service transformation is business transformation - user focussed service design needs to embrace all of the organisation’s business activities.

### Agile Coaching

In Agile Coaching,  an experienced coach observes the team to understand what attitudes, practices and communication problems are keeping them from being more effective.

Throughout the process, the Agile Coach will work with staff members to identify issues that are disrupting workflow, causing duplication of work or wasted effort.  The coach will identify patterns of behaviour that are negatively impacting the team and offer potential solutions.
