## What is DTS?

We live in a world where most citizens expect public services to be digital.  Many organisations are looking to transform the way they work to meet these expectations and the needs of their users.

Digital transformation involves thinking  about how your organisation can change the way it works to adapt to these new digital user needs. To do this, there may need to be changes to an organisation’s:

* culture
* processes
* technology

These fundamental parts of an organisation are not easy to transform and many organisations don’t know where to begin. That’s where the Scottish Government’s Digital Transformation Service (DTS) can help.

## About DTS

DTS was established in August 2015 and has worked with organisations across the Central Government sector including…

It has offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee.

DTS works collaboratively with organisations to deliver business transformation and fit for purpose public services.

This work includes:

* building digital strategies
* business cases
* designing technology platforms  building digital skills
* digital maturity models

There is more information about each of these below.

## Services offered

### Digital Maturity Model (DMM)

The DMM provides a benchmark of the digital maturity of an organisation. This is established by checking digital capability in five key areas:

* Customer Focus
* Collaboration & Value For Money  
* Data – Openness & Privacy
* Skills & Capability
* Strategy & Leadership

To do this, DTS carry out a facilitated workshop where participants are asked a series of questions to rate their organisation’s digital maturity.

It is a way to bench mark where your organisation is before creating a Digital Strategy.

#### Outputs

A report capturing what the organisation’s digital capability is by using the following tools:

* Overall maturity scoring
* Scoring per principle
* SWOT Analysis, detailed findings and additional relevant information  
* Benefits to clients

With the report the organisation can:

* Assess digital capability against established standards
* Start to determine the digital direction of travel and desired outcomes ?
* Understand high-level pressing needs and quick wins
* Start to inform a Digital Strategy and roadmap for improvement

### Value Chain Mapping

Value Chain Mapping offers a process and practice to gain genuine insights into an organisation and the environment in which it operates. (needs to be clearer)

The exercise usually takes place before a strategy is devised or when there is a desire to revise the current strategy.

#### Activities

This exercise is usually split into stages:

* A facilitated workshop with relevant stakeholders
* An initial basic map after the collection of initial data illustrating participants and functions
* Adjusted mapping, which is conducted following additional and follow-on interviews.
* Having completed both stages of the Value Chain Mapping process, DTS are able to map the components and dependencies of a service

#### Outputs

* Value Chain Maps (can we use an image to demonstrate)
* High-level analysis & recommendations

#### Benefits to clients

* Gives an organisation situational awareness and a better sense of how they function
* Better understanding of organisational risks
* Helps to identify skill gaps
* Helps organisations understand patterns in their sector
* Feeds contextual analysis as part of a Digital Strategy

### User Research

User research focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations. These are collected by using observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.

#### Activities

* Senior Team Orientation
* User Research Alignment Workshop
* Co-design Workshop
* User Journey Mapping
* Contextual Interviews

#### Outputs

The outputs of the activities will vary according to what has been executed and the outcomes.

Benefits to clients
•	Identifies main user groups and new audiences
•	Identifies possible user barriers to service adoption
•	Enhanced user experience leads to better engagement
•	Informs service design

### Process Mapping

Business Process Modelling develops visual aids which help understand and document how an organisation works.

These take two forms:
1) ‘As-is’ models which will help identify how effectively and efficiently an organisation is currently working and where incremental improvements can be obtained

2) ‘To-be’ models design the activities that will determine how new or changed services will be managed within the organisation.

‘To-be’ models will usually be accompanied by significant business, policy or ICT changes.

Business Analysts  work with staff to explore work processes gently probe to elicit further information as required

#### Outputs

Visual aids to understand the organisation include – each of these need an explanation or an example:

* Swim lane diagrams
* Context diagrams
* Data flow diagram
* Process Flow
* Cross skilling of basic notation skills for staff involved?

It will also provide a gap analysis and document quick wins for "as-is" models and resource requirements for "to-be" models.

During the process modelling it is not unusual to identify organisational risks that are not currently on the organisation’s risk register.

#### Benefits to clients

* Gain insights into how effectively or efficiently it is operating
* Decide which quick wins to implement
* Create efficiencies due to implementation of quick wins
* Create a change schedule for longer term changes
* Understand how new services will be delivered and the resource model required to support them
* Use the models as effective training tools
* Register any new risks in the risk register and create a risk management plan

### Technical Survey

A Technical Survey gathers and analyses information about the digital and ICT architecture currently operating within an organisation.

The scope of the survey will typically include applications, information/data and technology architecture. It may also include some business architecture artefacts linked to other Discovery activities.

The scope of the survey can be tailored to consider subsets of the architecture that are of specific interest for example …

The Architecture Survey also considers the principles used to set the digital/ICT direction/policy and considers risks existing in the current architecture.

At the conclusion of the project, the organisation will receive guidance which will cover some/all of the following:

* Identify key risks existing in the current architecture and suggest possible changes
* Make suggestions to improve the productivity and cost-effectiveness of the current architecture
* Consider the technical governance process and make suggestions about how this may be improved and give advice about SG digital strategy and policy (e.g. Digital First Service Standard)
* Assess how well the current solutions support the provision of Digital Public Services and again make suggestions on possible next steps

#### Activities

* Architecture Principles Review
* Application Catalogue
* Information/Data Catalogue
* Technology Catalogue
* Key Solution Quality Assessment
* Architecture RAID Log

#### Outputs
There are two levels of output:

1. A high level or Lightweight Architecture Survey which  usually gives a  small number of key solutions
2. A more comprehensive Architecture Survey report that offers different technical solutions which support the delivery of services to a lower level

#### Benefits to clients

* Provides a view of alignment of architecture to the organisation's business/digital/ICT strategies and wider Scottish Government guidance.
* Gives evidence-based snapshot of the Information & Communication Technology (ICT) status including an overview of the Business, Application, Data & Technology Architecture
* Includes an overview of in-flight ICT programmes to ensure systems support current/future services
* Identification and management of architecture and technical risks
* Provides input into a Digital Strategy and acts as a starting point for an Architecture Roadmap to plan Digital Transformation

### Digital Strategy

A Digital Strategy is best described as ‘a plan for maximising the business benefits of data assets and technology-focused initiatives’.

A digital strategy aligns an organisation’s digital vision, objectives & activities . A user-centred Digital Strategy will enable the organisation to deliver services more efficiently and successfully.

The services offered by DTS during the Discovery are critical to give a view of the current state of the organisation. This, aligned to a horizon scan, will form the basis of the strategy.

The Digital Strategy will generate high-level activities and a roadmap will show  the key  activities your organisation wants to do and when it wants to do them ..

#### Activities

* Current State Analysis
* Horizon Scan
* Digital Vision
* Objectives & Benefits
* Establish Design and Technology Principles
* High-level activities & Roadmap

#### Outputs

It is recommended that the strategy itself is a lightweight document that is clear and easily  understood. The approach and materials to support the strategy may be added in the appendices or in a separate document.

#### Benefits to clients

* Creates a living document which is co-authored with the organisation
* Provides a clear roadmap to transformation
* Frames the delivery activities

### Business Case

High-level activities as identified in a strategy will often require an outline or full Business Case which DTS can support or develop. For example…

Business cases should be developed over time. It is an iterative process and at each key stage further details are added. The three key stages are strategy, outline business case and Full Business Case.

The Business Case can be presented in various forms ranging from a well-structured written document to a visual presentation.

A compelling business case captures  the quantifiable and non-quantifiable characteristics of a  project. In most cases, there is great scope for opportunity should the Business Case be successful.

#### Activities

* Full Business Case
* Outline Business Case
* Agile Business Case

#### Tools

* Background and drivers
* Business options analysis and recommended option
* Commercial model
* Resources
* Costs and benefits projections

The Scottish Approach to Service Design Champions Programme is designed to be taken by a group of staff who represent key areas and grades within your organisation.

Some will be working in digital areas, some will not be. Digital service transformation is business transformation - user focussed service design  needs to embrace all of the organisation’s business activities.

#### Activities

Over three months, participants have 4 full day sessions of group learning, 2 one-to-one coaching sessions, and work based learning tied to live projects in their organisation.

The programme is supported by a ‘toolkit’ for use in future activities, session notes and a guided reading list.
