## What is DTS?

We live in a world where most citizens expect public services to be digital.  Many organisations are looking to transform the way they work to meet these expectations and the needs of their users.

Digital transformation involves thinking  about how your organisation can change the way it works to adapt to these new digital user needs. To do this, organisations may need to change their:

* culture
* processes
* technology

These fundamental parts of an organisation are not easy to transform and many organisations do not know where to begin. This is where the Scottish Government’s Digital Transformation Service (DTS) can help.

## About DTS

DTS has worked with organisations across the Public Sector including the, Food Standards Scotland, Forestry Commission, Transport Scotland and Scottish Courts.

This work includes building digital skills, strategies, designing technology platforms, business cases, recruitment and carrying out digital maturity assessment. To find out more about the services DTS offer click [here]({{ site.url }}/services/dts-services).
