## Strategy

A digital strategy aligns an organisationâ€™s digital vision, objectives & activities. A user-centred Digital Strategy will enable the organisation to deliver services more efficiently and successfully.

The services offered by DTS are critical to provide a view of the current state of the organisation. This, aligned to a horizon scan, will form the basis of the strategy.

The Digital Strategy will generate high-level activities and a roadmap will show the key activities your organisation wants to do and when it wants to do them.
