## Discovery

The activities carried out In Discovery help organisations understand their current state in a number of important areas.

The recommended entry point for organisations is the Digital Maturity Model.

 As a facilitated exercise, this encourages discussion and debate around the current state of digital maturity.  With Value Chain Mapping, this can be an effective first step towards business transformation.

The deeper Discovery activities will vary according to the organisation and need. These products have been categorised into four key areas:

* Users
* Business Processes
* Technology & Data
* People

There is not a model transformation journey and DTS will analyse each organisation's need on a case-by-case basis.  Please contact us to find out more.

### Digital Maturity Model (DMM)

The DMM provides a benchmark  of the digital maturity of an organisation. This is established by checking digital capability in five key areas:

* Customer Focus
* Collaboration & Value For Money  
* Data – Openness & Privacy
* Skills & Capability
* Strategy & Leadership

DTS carry out a facilitated workshop where participants are asked a series of questions to rate their organisation’s digital maturity.

### Value Chain Mapping

Value Chain Mapping is a tool used to identify where value can be added and where waste can be reduced .

The exercise usually takes place before a strategy is being devised or when there is a desire to revise the current strategy.

### User Research

User research focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations. These are collected by using observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.


### Process Mapping

Business Process Modelling develops visual aids which  show how an organisation works (need to include example). These take two forms:

1)	‘As-is’ models which will help identify how effectively and efficiently an organisation is currently working and where incremental improvements can be obtained
2)	‘To-be’ models design the activities that will determine how new or changed services will be managed within the organisation. ‘To-be’ models will usually be accompanied by significant business, policy or ICT changes.

### Technical Survey

A Technical Survey gathers and analyses information about an organisation’s digital and ICT architecture

The scope of the survey will typically include applications, information/data and technology architecture. It may also include some business architecture artefacts linked to other Discovery activities.

The scope of the survey can be tailored to consider subsets of the architecture that are of specific interest.

The Architecture Survey also considers the principles used to set the digital/ICT direction/policy and considers risks existing in the current architecture.
