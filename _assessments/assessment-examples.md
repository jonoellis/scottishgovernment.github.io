When you are deciding how to structure your assessment report, look at examples of different styles of reports used by the Government Digital Service.

## Examples

Assessment report structured by:

* area of expertise - [DVLA Webchat](/Example_1_-_DVLA_webchat.docx)
* individual criteria - [HM Passport Office online booking appointment](/Example_2_HMPO_Online_Appointment_Booking_(CHAMP).docx)
* service capability - [Check Your State Pension](/Example_3_check_your_state_pension.docx)

## Further information

There is an [assessment report template](/Assessment_report_template.docx) that you must use when compiling your feedback.

There is also a [style guide](/assessments/assessment-guide-to-writing-the-report) for the report that you must follow.
