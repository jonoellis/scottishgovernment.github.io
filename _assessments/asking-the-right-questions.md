During the assessment, it is important to ask the service team relevant questions. These will be different depending on what stage the digital project is at – find out more about agile stages for digital [projects](/assessments/agile-overview).

Your questions should not:

* be closed – ‘are your users citizens?’ is closed whereas ‘who are your users?’ is open
* not fishing for irrelevant information
* give options – ‘did you conduct usability testing in the lab or at home?’

Read the relevant document for the stage of the project you are assessing. You should take this document into the assessment with you.
