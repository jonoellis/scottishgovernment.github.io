Setting the standard for future transactional services on mygov.scot. The service standard is a draft set of principles that a future service must adhere to, unless a specific exception is made. 

We collectively refer to organisations responsible for providing transactional services as service providers.

The service standard is currently in draft, is highly likely to change and we proactively welcome feedback.
