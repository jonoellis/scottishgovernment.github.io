Setting the standard for digital services on mygov.scot. The service standard is a set of principles that a service must adhere to, unless a specific exception is made.

Principles within the standard comply and expand upon the [Scottish Government High Level Operating Framework](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/HLOF). The principles are educated by architectural principles sourced from [TOGAF](http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/). 

We collectively refer to organisations we work with, that are responsible for providing services, as service providers.

The service standard is currently in draft and open to feedback.
