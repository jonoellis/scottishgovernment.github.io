##Statement

Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis.

##Rationale

- .

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Mygov.scot will maintain directly, or indirectly, available skilled resources to assess and implement new capacity and technical capability to improve the service over its lifespan
* Mygov.scot will ensure products deliver and are designed, built and procured iteratively in modular form to support the frequent evolution of components without having to change the whole service
* Mygov.scot will ensure the difficult elements, such as continuous integration and loosely coupled services, required to support on-going frequent change are used
* Mygov.scot will continually evaluate the effectiveness of its technical and business operations to evaluate their ability to support frequent changes and evolve these if required
* Mygov.scot will provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide the information described below
* Mygov.scot will ensure contracts with suppliers are evaluated based on known sustainability requirements to ensure contracts that limit our ability to sustain and evolve a service are not used
* Mygov.scot will ensure that on going skills for team members will be maintained and evolved
* Mygov.scot will ensure that committed, realistic budgets will be identified and maintained to ensure services are sustained

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers must maintain on-going awareness of service evolution through established communication channels
* Service providers must embrace the concept of continuing evolution within their use of mygov.scot service either through embracing similar processes within their own organisation or a clear understanding and development of interfaces between out services which are frequently subject to change and their static processes
