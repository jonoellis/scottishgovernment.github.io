##Statement


##Rationale
* Mygov.scot will maintain directly, or indirectly, available skilled resources to assess and implement new capacity and technical capability to improve the service over its lifespan
* Mygov.scot will ensure products deliver and are designed, built and procured iteratively in modular form to support the frequent evolution of components without having to change the whole service
* Mygov.scot will ensure the difficult elements, such as continuous integration and loosely coupled services, required to support ongoing frequent change are used
* Mygov.scot will continually evaluate the effectiveness of its technical and business operations to evaluate their ability to support frequent changes and evolve these if required
* Mygov.scot will provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide the information described below
* Mygov.scot will ensure contracts with suppliers are evaluated based on known sustainability requirements to ensure contracts that limit our ability to sustain and evolve a service are not used
* Mygov.scot will ensure that on going skills for team members will be maintained and evolved
* Mygov.scot will ensure that committed, realistic budgets will be identified and maintained to ensure services are sustained

##Implications
*for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* Mygov.scot will obtain and maintain ongoing understanding regarding what elements of our services drive people to use the current service and communicate how these elements are delivered by alternative services after retirement of current ones or manage peoples expectations regarding why they are no longer available
* Plan and deliver the resources required to correctly sell and market new or modified services
* Understand who the service providers of a service are and how to effectively communicate with them 
* Mygov.scot will provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide the information described below
* Mygov.scot will ensure all data within the service is destroyed in a secure manner based on the nature of the data and the nature of the service in which it was used
* Mygov.scot must ensure that no intellectual property is lost during the retirement of a service
* Mygov.scot will work with the providers of replacement services for retiring ones to understand and where appropriate maintain reference data integrity such as reference numbers to assist users and service providers during transition
* Mygov.scot will work with service providers of retiring services as well as any service replacing it to understand how communication plans, training and documentation is being used manage the expectations of the users and ensure this is a positive experience for them

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers and potential service providers must maintain ongoing awareness of service evolution through established communication channels
* Service providers and potential service providers must embrace the concept of continuing evolution within their use of mygov.scot service either through embracing similar processes within their own organisation or a clear understanding and development of interfaces between out services which are frequently subject to change and their static processes
