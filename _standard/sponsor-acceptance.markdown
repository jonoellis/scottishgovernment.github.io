##Statement

Test the service from beginning to end with a responsible stakeholder to ensure alignment with expectations

##Rationale

* Stakeholder Engagement - The active support and involvement of a responsible stakeholder will help with marketing, iterating and running the service
* Feedback - A responsible stakeholder will recieve feedback from multiple sources to view help them view the service from other perspectives
* Advocacy - If the responsible stakeholder has used and supported the service through its creation, they will be more likely challenge the status quo

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Service providers will ensure the responsible stakeholder is clearly identified, alongside any others and is communicated to throughout development
* Service providers will develop user journeys with the product owner to enable them to demonstrate the service to stakeholders
* Service providers will plan for and deliver the demonstration to the minister including the review and incorporation of feedback where appropriate
* Service providers will arm the minister with correct, up to date, information tailored for the various target audience they need to discuss the service with.
