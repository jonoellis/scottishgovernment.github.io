##Statement

Test the service from beginning to end with the minister responsible for it.

##Rationale

* Stakeholder Engagement - Ministerial stakeholder engagement will make marketing, evolving and sustaining the service that much easier therefore is key to service longevity
* Feedback - A minister will receive feedback from other ministers, public sector bodies and citizens and can therefore view the service from these perspective and augment user needs information from other sources

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* Mygov.scot will ensure the sponsoring minister is aware of the current status of the service including any serious challenges so they are provided information rather than speculation and rumour
* Mygov.scot will develop user journeys with the product owner to enable them to demonstrate the service to the minister
* Mygov.scot will plan for and deliver the demonstration to the minister including the review and incorporation of feedback where appropriate
* Mygov.scot will arm the minister with correct, up to date, information tailored for the various target audience they need to discuss the service with

### for service providers of mygov.scot services
