##Statement

Use open standards and common government platforms (eg MyAccount) where available.

##Rationale

* Interoperability & integration – use of open standards increases the likelihood that solutions provided by different vendors will be capable of interoperating. This can simplify both the integration of multiple applications with a single system as well as increasing the likelihood that different organisations can integrate their systems without the need for additional work. It also increases the likelihood that an off-the-shelf solution can be selected for a particular task, avoiding the need for specially written software.  
* Simpler collaboration – use of open standards in such projects increases the likelihood that the solution will be generally applicable.
* Flexibility of use – use of open standards will provide a more level playing field for open source and proprietary software providers competing for government contracts.
* Value for money – proprietary or bespoke standards need not be defined, documented implemented and tested. This will lead to a reduction in the total cost of ownership for IT solutions.
* Avoiding lock-in – successful open standards are readily implemented by a broad variety of software vendors in either open source or proprietary solutions. This reduces the effort and complexity associated with use cases such as transitioning away from a system that is no longer supported or moving from one solution to a competitor that is more cost effective.
* Transparency – Open standards will make it easier for the public sector to share data with the public. In particular, non-proprietary formats are a key factor in enabling open data.
* Sustainability – Open standards allow large contracts to be broken down into several smaller components. This enables incremental delivery of complex solutions thus reducing risk, as well as providing a more level playing field for SMEs during procurement.

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Mygov.scot will utilise open standards solution if there is no material difference in cost for the technology or in its support and maintenance
* Mygov.scot will maintain directly, or indirectly, available skilled resources who understand open standards and the implications of their use in terms of specifying, procuring and maintaining open standards based solutions
* Mygov.scot will adopt and comply with open standards wherever possible including documenting that compliance for service providers and potential service providers
* Mygov.scot services will be delivered using standards published in the Scottish Government standards catalogue and where no suitable standard exists in the catalogue mygov.scot will produce a new standard and publish this through the catalogue
* Mygov.scot will identify and select or develop the most appropriate open standard for both human and computer system interfaces
* Mygov.scot will provide advice and guidance for service providers and prospective service providers regarding the use of open standards

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers and potential service providers must maintain ongoing awareness of open standards usage within mygov.scot
