##Statement
To manage the live operation in a manner that delivers the agreed service levels in terms of availability, performance and functionality. Put in place processes to manage incidents, changes and problems in order to reduce risk around system stability and to be able to respond efficiently to business and technical change.

##Rationale
* To manage the operation in line with best practice using the ITIL V3 framework. By having controlled processes and procedures in place this reduces risk to the services provided. Achievement against operational targets will be measured and monitored over time to ensure agreed targets are met or exceeded.
* Demonstrating Excellence - Through the utilisation of effective service operations we will maintain the good reputation of Scottish Government Digital Directorate
* Stable Service - Through managing the service, including its evolution, effectively we will ensure its stability and ensure customer expectations are met to enable us to maintain our existing customers and attract new customers to the service
* Foundation to Build Upon - Our services do not stand alone however they offer a valuable building block on which public sector bodies can build their services and through effective service operation we can ensure that our service is an effective foundation

##Implications

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers who are integrated with mygov.scot services must maintain the equivalent level of service operation to ensure a consistant stable, reliable service is made available to their users
* Service providers will provide regular through published mechanisms for issues to be managed and suggestions raised from citizens and businesses which will be evaluated and incorporated into service evolution
* Service providers will develop and maintain defined, documented, agreed and implemented integrated process with mygov.scot for processes such as incident management, request fulfilment, problem management, access management and service availability reporting
