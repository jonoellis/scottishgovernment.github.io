##Statement

Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them

##Rationale

* Suitability - Assessment of the technology must include all aspects of its adoption including elements such as warranty & indemnity, intellectual property rights, procurement, available procurement routes, timescales and training to give a true picture of which technology is the most appropriate choice
* Multiple perspectives - Ability to obtain a clear picture of different perspectives including security, performance, operations and cost to benefit
* Total Cost of Ownership - A total cost of ownership over a agreed period is a critical factor in the selection of technology, as primary costs such as software or hardware can quickly be overtaken by on-going service management costs
* Alignment to Strategies - The best short term solution is not always the best long term solution, thus decisions should be made on whether selection is a short or long term decision
* Entry and Exit Criteria - Avoid being locked into a technology on cost grounds even after it has outlived its usefulness by considering any potential costly or complex exit criteria up front
* Sustainability - The ability to maintain a technology in a suitable state is critical, therefore factors such as support availability, technical skills availability and product longevity should inform whether a technology will be sustainable of the period you intend to use it for
* Risks - A clear understanding the risks of choosing one technology over another is critical in identifying the right technology to use

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Ensure user needs drive technology assessments
* Esure that technology assessments will only take place after proper requirements gathering and technical architecture activities are completed to ensure that assessments are based on what we need technology to do and not based on what technology can do
* Technologies with limited information will be assessed internally using techniques such as proof of concept, research or alpha project to validate their suitability to deliver business requirements
* Technology selection assessments will be documented, allowing service providers to review this information in order to allow them to understand decisions made by mygov.scot and foster a sense of collaboration and partnership
* Provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide the information described below
* Current Scottish Government strategies will be used, including technology strategies like 'reusing before buying and buying before building'
* Technical options appraisals will be performed for key decisions using an established process and reporting mechanism within the program

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers must understand their requirements and communicate them to mygov.scot to ensure our technologies can deliver these requirements
