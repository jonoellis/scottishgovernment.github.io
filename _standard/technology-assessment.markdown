##Statement
Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them.

##Rationale
* Suitability - Assessment of the technology must include all aspects of its adoption including elements such as warranty & indemnity, intellectual property rights, procurement, available procurement routes, timescales and training to give a true picture of which technology is the most appropriate choice
* Multiple perspectives - In order to obtain a clear picture different perspectives including security, performance, operations and cost to benefit
* Total Cost of Ownership - Primary costs such as software or hardware are quickly overtaken by ongoing service management costs therefore a total cost of ownership over and agree period is a critical factor in the selection of the correct technology
* Alignment to Strategies - The best short term solution is not always the best long term strategic solution therefore this must form part of the assessment to understand if the selection is a short or long term decision
* Entry and Exit Criteria - Costly or complex exit criteria can result is technology remaining when it has long outlived its usefulness therefore this must be considered as must the entry criteria in particular where it cause time or complexity issue that need to be identified and understood
* Sustainability - The ability to maintain a technology in a suitable state is critical therefore factors such as support availability, technical skills availability and product  longevity will be critical to understand whether a technology will be sustainable of the period you intend to use it for
* Risks - Nothing is without risk including technology therefore a clear understanding the risks of choosing one technology over another is critical in identifying the right technology to use

##Implications
*for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* User needs will drive technology assessments
* Mygov.scot will ensure that technology assessment will only take place after proper requirements gathering and technical architecture activities are completed to ensure that assessments are based on what we need technology to do and not based on what technology can do
* Technologies with limited information will be assessed internally using techniques such as proof of concept, research or alpha project to validate their suitability to deliver business requirements
* Technology selection assessments will be documented to allow service providers and potential service providers to review this information in order to allow them to understand decisions made by mygov.scot and foster a sense of collaboration and partnership
* Mygov.scot must provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide the information described below
* Mygov.scot will follow current Scottish Government strategies in respect of reusing before buying and buying before building in respect of technology
* Mygov.scot will perform technical options appraisals for key technology decisions using an established process and reporting mechanism within the program

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers and potential service providers must understand their requirements and communicate them to mygov.scot to ensure our technologies can deliver these requirementsappropriately secure
