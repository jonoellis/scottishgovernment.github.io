##Statement
Appropriate service quality attributes will be defined prior to implementation, based on user needs and agreed by stakeholders.

##Rationale
* Mygov.scot through the definition of function and non-functional requirements, in the form of system quality attributes, will obtain and maintain a clear picture of how the service will be used and therefore how fitness for use can be verified
* Mygov.scot through principles such as technology assessment, sustainability, operational acceptance and continuous delivery will ensure at all stages of specification and delivery that functional and non-functional requirements are understood and verified so that the delivered service is fit for use
* Mygov.scot will utilise collaborative development of services to ensure service provider and their users needs are captured and remain at the forefront of the requirements of the service

##Implications
*for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* Mygov.scot will ensure service providers specify requirements that are SMART to ensure relevant functional and non-functional requirements, in the form of system quality attributes
* Mygov.scot will collect and maintain awareness of user needs in respect of their service through both direct data collection and research as well as provision of user needs data from service providers and potential service providers
* Mygov.scot product owners will define standard non-functional requirements in the form of system quality attributes which will drive aspects of procurement, delivery, testing and service management
* Mygov.scot will publish the system quality attribute information for the service to service providers and potential service providers
* Mygov.scot will provider further guidance on system quality attributes as a mechanism for specifying non-functional requirements when required
* Mygov.scot will review and accept the quality attribute realisation plan

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers and potential service providers must review the published system quality attributes to confirm the suitability of the mygov.scot services
* Service providers and potential service providers must provide details of their future expectations from mygov.scot services to ensure these evolve into the services they need
* Service providers will plane to realise and verify non0-functional requirements, in the form of system quality attributes, during the discovery phase of transition
