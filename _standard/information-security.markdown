##Statement

Evaluate what user data and information the service will be providing or storing, and address the security level, legal responsibilities, and risks associated with the service (consulting with experts where appropriate)

##Rationale

* Complete coverage - Through understanding data and information, relevant threats will be identified to ensure decisions are made based on a full understanding
* Balanced approach - Security elements that affect confidentiality, availability and integrity can be considered in balance so that technical risk mitigation is not made at the expense of service usability unless the security level demands it
* Value for money - Risk mitigation solutions should not be deployed when the cost of mitigating the risk is greater than the value gained from mitigating it
* Prepared for change - By understanding why security decisions were made, future proposed changes can be impact assessed to ensure the security of a service evolves to meet the needs of the service
* Understanding - A clear understanding of the data and information along with the security required is critical to the successful delivery and secure operation of a service, meaningful risk management and the evaluation of the suitability of 3rd party suppliers

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Ensure risk management is an integral part of service delivery with the information asset owner maintaining responsibility for risk appetite and the mitigation of unacceptable risks to user data and information
* Assess risk impact on user data and information is assessed as part of any proposed changes to the service
* Information security information is published on request to existing or prospective service providers to enable them to evaluate any residual security risks to their user data and information
* Provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide information regarding their data, its sensitivity, the impact in respect of its accuracy/availability and ownership

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Review the published information regarding mygov.scot information security regularly to understand any residual risks to their user data and information
* Provide information regarding their user data and information being handled by mygov.scot such as whether it is personal, whether it is sensitive, what impact the accuracy/availability of the information can have on citizens and whether the data owner has approved sharing it with mygov.scot
* Comply with restrictions imposed by mygov.scot in respect of access control, data transfer, user validation and risk management in order to ensure their user data and information, and that of other service providers, remains appropriately secure
