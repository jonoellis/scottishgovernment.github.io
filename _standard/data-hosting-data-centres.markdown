##Statement

Adopt cloud computing or virtualisation as the preferred approaches to service hosting.

##Rationale

* Strategic Alignment - Adherance to the Scottish Government data hosting and data centre strategy for the Scottish public sector
* Procurement - Evaluate and procure data hosting and data centre services with the elasticity, resilience and recoverability required to achieve the non-functional requirements of the service, expressed in the form of system quality attributes
* Cost Savings - Realise public sector cost savings through increasing collaborative ICT procurement and will achieve further savings through the evaluation, where applicable, utilisation of a 'utility computing' model
* Hosting agility - Utilise data hosting and data centres to increase technical agility
* Carbon Footprint - Reduction in Scotlandâ€™s carbon footprint through the procurement, evaluation and utilisation of data hosting and data centres with proven track records in carbon savings

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers must evaluate their use of mygov.scot services in terms of their compliance with the Scottish Government Data Hosting and Data Centres strategy
* Service providers must maintain awareness of mygov.scot strategic plans in respect of managing their data using cloud and data centre services and the associated impact on service availability, integrity, confidentiality, personal data protection and compliance
