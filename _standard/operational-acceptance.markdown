##Statement

Be able to test the end-to-end service in an environment identical to that of the live version on all common browsers and devices. Use dummy accounts and a representative sample of users

##Rationale

* Fitness - The transactional service's fitness for use (functional requirements) and fitness for purpose (quality attributes) have been validated and verified prior to go live
* Support - Ensure commitment of support services such as infrastructure for the service prior to launch
* Component Integration - Validate integration with shared service components such as system monitoring, security and service reporting
* Browsers & Devices - Validate the behaviour of the service in circumstances common to the users of the service such as various browsers and mobile devices   

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Mygov.scot will produce a test strategy and associated test plan prior to implementation which will include all functional and non-functional aspects
* Mygov.scot will document any necessary variations, including the risks associated with these variations, between live environments and environments used for testing
* Mygov.scot will produce test plans related to the verification of non-functional requirements expressed in the form of system quality attributes
* Mygov.scot will utilise, or develop if required, test methodologies to verify functional and non-functional requirements
* Mygov.scot will produce test completion reports to detail how the functional and non-functional requirements expressed in the form of system quality attributes have been verified either through test results or reference to alternative mechanisms such as contract clauses, operational agreements and observed tests 

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers must provide the necessary skills and resources to help us produce test plans based on user needs and business requirements
* Service providers must provide the necessary skills and resources to help us execute operational acceptance for product delivery 
* Service providers must provide evidence of their compliance with the agreed system quality attributes using mechanisms such as test completion report test results or reference to alternative mechanisms such as contract clauses, operational agreements and observed tests.
