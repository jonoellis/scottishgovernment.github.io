##Statement

Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or give a convincing explanation as to why this can’t be done for specific subsets of the source code)

##Rationale

* Simpler collaboration – For several Scottish public sector organisations to work collaboratively on a shared service or solution there must be clear agreement on, and understanding of, how intellectual property rights will be managed. Open source licensing resolves this issue ensuring that an acceptable, well understood set of rights are conferred to all parties
* Value for money – a charge is not typically applied to license open source software so solutions, applications or libraries created by a Scottish public sector body may be easily re-used by other bodies under an open source license. This will lead to a reduction in the total cost of ownership for IT solutions
* Transparency – open source licenses typically confer to users the right to study the source code for the solution. This simplifies any necessary audit that must take place for a system in order to guarantee that the solution is free from security vulnerabilities, back-doors, tracking capabilities or other information rights issues

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Mygov.scot will proatively consider open source options, as well as proprietary ones, when devising solutions and making procurement decisions
* Mygov.scot will request suppliers to provide proposals incorporating a creative mix of open source and proprietary products to ensure that a best value for money and functionally sound solution is presented
* Mygov.scot will ensure software produced in-house, or through publicly funded research and development projects, is made available as free open source software for use by other public bodies
* Mygov.scot will identify any specially written software assets required to devise or deliver a service and will publish information regarding how these will be made open source products including their licensing and publication through technologies such as Github

### for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers will proatively consider open source options, as well as proprietary ones, when devising solutions integrated with mygov.scot 
* Service providers will identify any specially written software assets required to devise or deliver a service and will publish information regarding how these will be made open source products including their licensing and publication through technologies such as Github
