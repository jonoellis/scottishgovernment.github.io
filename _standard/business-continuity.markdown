##Statement
Make a plan for the event of the service being taken temporarily offline.

##Rationale
* Understanding - Critical to maintaining the continuity of a service is understanding what threatens that service including supplier failures, environmental factors or even social trends
* Planning - Once threats are identified a plan for addressing the situations is required where the response is appropriate to the likelihood of something happening and the implications on the availability of a service
* Testing - Continuity always involves a combination of technical, governance and operational factors and only by testing these can the true capabilities of these components be assessed whether this is a simple table top exercise scenario or full activation of all components
* Continual improvement - Change is inevitable and many factors will not be within your control therefore the plans need to be re-evaluated to ensure that they continue to be appropriate to changing threats

##Implications
*for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* Mygov.scot will utilise skills and resources to understand the threats events that can impact business continuity
* Mygov.scot will utilise skills and resources to detect threat events in order to enact continuity plans
* Mygov.scot will implement technology and processes required to mitigate continuity threats to the service to an appropriate level based on the likelihood of the event and the value of the service
* Mygov.scot will regularly test the threat event scenarios to ensure that effectiveness of business continuity planning
* Mygov.scot must publish clear information regarding availability expectations for the service to enable service providers and potential service providers to make informed decisions regarding their usage of the service
* Mygov.scot will provide advise and guidance in the areas of business continuity and disaster recovery for service providers and potential service providers when required
* Mygov.scot will review business continuity and disaster recovery plans for service providers prior to going live

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers must provide information regarding what impact the availability of the information within the service can have on citizens
* Service providers must understand and accept availability, recoverability and performance restrictions on the service during threat event scenarios
* Service providers must agreed to a business continuity and disaster recovery process including a series of planned tests prior to going live and an agreed schedule of regular testing
* Service providers must identify realistic availability and recoverability targets for their use of mygov.scot and any of their own service integrated to it
