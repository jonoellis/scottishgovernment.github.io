##Statement
Evaluate what user data and information the service will be providing or storing, and address the security level, legal responsibilities, and risks associated with the service (consulting with experts where appropriate).

##Rationale
* Complete coverage - Through understanding the data and information the relevant threats identified to ensure decisions are made based on a clear picture and not limited facts
* Balanced approach - Security elements that affect confidentiality, availability and integrity can be considered in balance so that technical risk mitigation is not made at the expense of service usability unless the security level demands it
* Value for money - Risk mitigation solutions must not be deployed when the cost of mitigating the risk is greater than the value gained from mitigating it
* Prepared for change - By understanding why security decisions were made future proposed changes can be impact assessed correctly to ensure the security of a service evolves to meet the needs of the evolving service
* Understanding - Whether it is service providers understanding the security a service has, an information asset owner deciding risk appetite or 3rd party suppliers being evaluated for suitability; a clear understanding of the data and information along with the security required is critical

##Implications
*for delivery of the mygov.scot service*
* Risk management is an integral part of service delivery for mygov.scot services with the information asset owner maintaining responsibility for risk appetite and the mitigation of unacceptable risks to user data and information
* Risk impact on user data and information is assessed by mygov.scot as part of any proposed changes to the service
* Information security information regarding the mygov.scot service is published on request to￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ existing or prospective service providers to enable them to evaluate any residual security risks to their user data and information in using mygov.scot
* Mygov.scot must provide resources, solutions and guidance for service providers and potential service providers to allow them to provide information regarding their data, its sensitivity, the impact in respect of its accuracy/availability and ownership

*for service providers of mygov.scot services*
* Service providers must review the published information regarding mygov.scot information security regularly to understand any residual risks to their user data and information
* Service providers must provide information regarding their user data and information being handled by mygov.scot such as whether it is personal, whether it is sensitive, what impact the accuracy/availability of the information can have on citizens and whether the data owner has approved sharing it with mygov.scot
* Service providers must comply with restrictions imposed by mygov.scot in respect of access control, data transfer, user validation and risk management in order to ensure their user data and information, and that of other service providers, remains appropriately secure
