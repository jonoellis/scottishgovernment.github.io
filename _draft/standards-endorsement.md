## Introduction

This paper documents a process, which could be used within Scottish Government, to suggest and endorse technical standards for the Scottish public sector.

<div class="info-note caution">Please note this document is currently in <strong>draft</strong> status and may be subject to change. We are happy to receive feedback on this document via the channels in the footer.</div>

Use of common standards, and in particular open standards, has significant potential benefits for the Scottish public sector including simplified interoperation & integration, reduced vendor lock-in and more sustainable procurement. The defined process should give organisations within Scottish public sector a suitable level of assurance and guidance.

## Background

The [High Level Operating Framework](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/06/1690/downloads) (October 2013) emphasises the importance of open standards and policies in the definition of IT solutions. The mygov programme has been tasked, by the Scottish Government Technical and Design Board, to deliver an approach to technical standards endorsement that can be used within the Scottish public sector.

The process proposed has matured from an initial five steps to eight. The process adopts learning’s from the UK Government approach. It is thought that the new approach will provide an additional level of assurance to the Scottish public sector when being asked to adhere to endorsements made by The Scottish Government.

Other strategies also supporting the endorsement and use of open standards include [Scotland’s Digital Future: Delivery of Public Services](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0040/00407741.pdf) (September 2012) and [Scotland’s Digital Future - Delivery of Public Services, Central Government Strategy](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00414287.pdf) (February 2013).

The process also acknowledges current UK Government policy.  The UK Government has both established [Open Standards Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78892/Open-Standards-Principles-FINAL.pdf) (November 2012) and has embarked on wide consultation through an [Open Standards Consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78889/Government-Response.pdf) (November 2012) – touching both civil and non-civil servants. The Scottish Government will publish an updated policy on Open Source and Open Standards later this year.

## Objectives

The process should:

- Identify the relevant roles and responsibilities;
- Identify stages from initial suggestion through to implementation and review;
- Suggest activities to be undertaken at each stage;
- Provide a suitable level of assurance to the Scottish public sector that endorsed standards are appropriate to their needs and that meeting those standards is acheivable;
- Ensure transparency and equitability.


## Roles and Responsibilities

### Service Provider
Service providers include individuals or organisations within Scottish Government and Scottish public sector who are primarily interested in building digital services or integrating with existing services. Service providers will likely have expertise in designing, building and acquiring IT systems.

### Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)
A senior responsible owner should be responsible for assessing suggestions where the use of standards could provide benefit. A senior responsible owner should be appointed from within Scottish Government and will act as a sponsor. They should identify the business purpose, be knowledgeable in the area and champion implementation.

### User Intelligence Group (UIG)
The user intelligence group should be responsible for investigating and appraising challenges as well as providing subject matter expertise. The user intelligence group should include broad sectoral representation and will likely include a proportion of service providers.

### Scottish Government Governance Boards & Groups
A governance board or working group should be utilised to provide the final endorsement of a standard (or standards). They should be representative and be in a position to make an informed decision after consultation.

The current Scottish Government boards, which would be considered to have an interest in the approval of  standards, include:

- Scottish Government Technical & Design Board, supported by the Open Standards and Open Source Advisory Group
- Scottish Government Data Management Board, supported by the Open Data Working Group
- Mygov.scot Board, supported by the Planning, Advisory & Implementation Group

It is suggested that the Technical & Design Board fulfil the role of endorsing standards relevant to the public sector as a whole. This is dependent upon there being subject matter knowledge within the user intelligence group to provide suitable assurance to the board.  

### Technology Leaders

A technology leader will be a responsible individual from Scottish Government or Scottish public sector tasked with overseeing the implementation of endorsed standards in their directorate or organisation. Technology leaders may also create new suggestions.


## Recommendation and Endorsement Process

### 1. Suggestion

Any public sector employee can propose suggestions on areas where standards would solve a particular challenge they face. Suggestions should provide a short description, outline a clear user need and explore any associated benefits. Suggestions would be submitted to the relevant programme or sectoral design authority.

The design authority will assess the suggestion to see if it is something that is appropriate for standardisation. This will include understanding the need and associated benefits.

If it is agreed that a suggestion should develop into a challenge, a senior responsible owner should be appointed ideally from the design authority community. The senior responsible owner should be picked based upon expertise and influence. They will mature the suggestion and will be expected to own the challenge and lead the subsequent endorsement process.


### 2. Challenge

The challenge should provide a short description, articulate a clear user need, expected benefits and technical or functional requirements.

The senior responsible owner will be responsible for publishing the challenge. The challenge should be made available in a way that maximises its exposure and ensures a suitable level of feedback is received as to its appropriateness.

This could involve the creation of some form of central solution, in the form of a website.

### 3. Investigation

The senior responsible owner should look to initiate an investigation of relevant existing standards. *Wherever possible the standard should be an open standard*. This will involve forming a short life ‘user intelligence group’ (UIG), with the expectation that they may provide advice on what relevant standards are available to address the challenge.

Either a single proposal or multiple proposals may be available at this stage, depending upon the outcome of the appraisal. Each proposal will outline a specific standard.

The challenge should have received enough feedback from service providers and / or technology leaders, as well as from the UIG, such that it becomes possible to decide whether or not to progress to a more formal appraisal. The decision to progress lies with the senior responsible owner.

Each standard taken forward from this stage will be described as a “ proposed standard”.

### 4. Appraisal

The user intelligence group should be responsible for the appraisal of the standard proposal(s) that have been identified during investigation of the challenge. This will include an assessment of each proposed standard’s technical, sectoral and national applicability.

An objective and relative assessment of the proposals will be made by the UIG, with guidance from the senior responsible owner. The senior responsible owner will then decide whether to take the preferred proposal through to recommendation.

If a standard is taken forward from the appraisal stage it will be described as a “provisional standard”. Sectors / programmes may choose to adopt provisional standards under ‘pilot conditions’ to provide further information with regards to the standard’s viability.

### 5. Recommendation

If appraisal indicates that a suitable standard exists to address the challenge it will be formally documented as a recommendation. The recommendation should clearly articulate:

- Applicability to the challenge;
- Justification for selection;
- Credibility of standards body;
- Credibility of standardisation approach;
- Breadth of experience of membership for standardisation process;
- Depth of experience of membership for standardisation process;
- Length of time standard has existed;
- Industry acceptance or adoption;
- Evidence of successful use;
- Alignment with EU / UK / Scottish legislation.

### 6. Endorsement

Having reached the decision that a standard should proceed to recommendation, the next step is for submission to the appropriate sectoral board or design authority for approval. (For example the mygov.scot board, the Local Government ICT Strategy Board, SWAN Design Authority).

If the sectoral board endorses the recommendation and it is identified that the standard has relevance to the whole Scottish public sector, then the recommendation will be passed to the national design authority for review on behalf of the Technology & Design Board.

Should the Technical & Design Board choose to endorse the recommendation, then adherence to the standard will become mandatory within the Scottish Government and Scottish public sector. It would be expected that an architectural principle would be added to the High Level Operating Framework to reflect the new standard.

If a standard is endorsed by a sector / programme design authority or The Technical & Design Board it will referred to as an “active standard”.

### 7. Implementation

The implementation of a standard would be mandatory by all technology leaders (at sectoral or national level) after endorsement. The senior responsible owner should provide guidance that will be made available to technology leaders who are responsible for implementation.

The technology leader will be responsible for ensuring digital systems within their directorate or organisation implement any endorsed standards. Standards should be implemented both for the acquisition (COTS) and construction (specially written software) of IT systems.

There should also be a method for tracking implementation. It is suggested technology leaders publish progress against endorsed standards.


### 8. Review

As a part of the endorsement step above, a target review date will be specified for the standard. A typical review frequency for a standard would be every 12 months. When the review target date is passed the Technical & Design Board will ask the sectoral / programme board that proposed the standard to perform a review of the standard to confirm that it is still relevant to and applicable for the Scottish public sector.

If the standard is still applicable the Technical and Design board will update the target review data and the Scottish public sector will continue to implement the standard. If the standard is no longer applicable the standard will be marked as "obsolete". The Technical & Design Board will communicate that the standard has been obsoleted and sectors / programmes will evaluate and realise any appropriate remedial action.

The Technical & Design Board may, if appropriate, initiate further research or other consultation to identify a relevant standard that covers equivalent subject matter to the now obsolete standard.
