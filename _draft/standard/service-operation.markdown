##Statement

To manage the live operation in a manner that delivers the agreed service levels in terms of availability, performance and functionality by establishing clear processes to manage incidents, changes and problems in order to reduce risk around system stability and respond efficiently to business and technical change.

##Rationale

* Risk Reducation - Managing operation in line with best practice based on the ITIL V3 framework will allow for the implementation of controlled processes and procedures that reduce risk. Allow for on-going monitoring of operational targets
* Reputation - Through effective service operations we will maintain the good reputation of mygov.scot and service providers
* Stable Service - Through managing the service, including its evolution, effectively we will ensure its stability and to increase usage
* Foundation - Offer a valuable foundation on which public sector bodies can build their services on

##Implications

### for delivery of the mygov.scot service

* Mygov.scot will ensure an orderly transition from development into live operations
* Mygov.scot will manageme change through a change management board to ensure changes are impact assessed, approved, business value assessed and are effective in maintaining the stability of the service
* Mygov.scot will ensure that stable, documented and approved processes are used in the on going management of services to maintain reliability without sacrificing the ability to evolve

###for service providers of mygov.scot services

* Service providers must maintain the equivalent level of service operation to ensure a consistant, stable, reliable service is made available to their users
* Service providers will raise issues through agreed routes and will manage suggestions from citizens and businesses through evaluating and incorporating them into future iterations
* Service providers will define, document, agree and implement an intergrated process with mygov.scot for areas such as incident management, request fulfilment, problem management, access management and service availability reporting
