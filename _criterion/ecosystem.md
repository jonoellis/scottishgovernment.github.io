Identify how your service aligns with Scotland’s digital ecosystem.

## How point 14 improves the service

The Digital Ecosystem allows for knowledge transfer and the reuse of capabilities developed across a variety of service patterns.

* other services can reuse the capabilities they’ve created
* other services don’t end up doing work they’ve already done and they reduce costs in government as a whole

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have thought about how their service will interact with Scotland’s digital ecosystem
* show that they are aware of their service pattern
* show that they have considered where common capabilities from the digital ecosystem fit in with their service
* show that they have undertaken value chain mapping

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have an understanding of the digital ecosystem and which service patterns they align with
* show that they can demonstrate a knowledge of where common capabilities sit within their service and how they can make use of or contribute to the digital ecosystem

### In the beta assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they can show awareness of the principles of the digital ecosystem approach and demonstrate their service pattern
* show what value chain mapping has been undertaken by the service
* show that they can demonstrate an understanding of where common capabilities sit within their service
* show that they have considered other organisations that may be partners with which they can share common knowledge and capabilities
* show that they can hold discussions with the Digital Ecosystems Unit on how they can use capabilities from, or contribute to, the digital ecosystem
