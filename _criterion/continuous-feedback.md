Put a plan in place for on-going user research and usability testing to continuously seek feedback and input from users to improve the service.

## How point 2 improves their service

Doing ongoing user research means they can:

* check their service is helping users to do the tasks they need to do
* keep improving the service based on users’ needs

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment
To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show:

* a plan for continuing engagement and research with users, including those needing assisted digital support, in alpha

### In the alpha assessment

To pass the alpha assessment, they usually need to show:

* what their private beta will look like and how they’ll use what they find to improve the service
* they will pay for user research, service design and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it’s built
* how often they’ll carry out research and usability tests and how they’ll use the results to improve the design of their service
* a user research plan for private beta and a plan for carrying out user research on the live service

### In the beta assessment

To pass the beta assessment, they usually need to show:

* they will pay for user research, service design and usability tests throughout the design of the service and they’ll be able to pay after the service is built
* how often they’ll carry out research and usability tests and how the results will affect the way they design the service
* a user research plan for the service at the next phase and a plan for carrying out user research on the live service
* how they’ve done user research with people who have accessibility needs from the time they started designing the service
* how they’ve tested with users who need assisted digital support
* how they’re using analytics data in their user research plan for the service
* any problems they’ve found through testing and how they solved them
* any problems they haven’t been able to solve in beta and how they’ll handle them in public beta
