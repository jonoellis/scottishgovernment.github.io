# 16. Performance Management

Identify performance indicators for the service, including the 4 mandatory key performance indicators (KPI) defined in the GDS service manual. Establish a benchmark for each metric and make a plan to enable improvements.

## How point 16 improves their service

Setting performance indicators allows they to continuously improve their service by:

* learning its strengths and weaknesses
* using data to support improvements they make

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show:

* how they will set a baseline from the existing service, if applicable
* they’ve investigated means by which to improve on the KPIs
* they’ve considered any other metrics they may wish to measure

### In the alpha and beta assessments

To pass the alpha and beta assessments, they usually need to explain:

* how they’ve set a performance baseline for the old service, if there was one
* their plan to lower [cost per transaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-cost-per-transaction) or equivalent, for non-transactional user journeys
* their plan to [improve user satisfaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction)
* their plan to [increase completion rate](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-completion-rate) or equivalent, for non-transactional user journeys
* their plan to [increase digital take-up](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/encouraging-people-to-use-your-digital-service) and reduce reliance on assisted digital

They also need to explain:

* how they’ve assessed the potential for channel shift and the level of assisted digital their service needs
* other metrics that they’ll measure, when they’ll start, and how they’ll use them to improve their service
* where they’re getting the data for their metrics
* how they’ve set up their analytics package to collect user journey data
* how they’ve made sure all stakeholders are actively involved in promoting or supporting digital delivery of the new service
* how they’ll track people moving from using the offline service to the online one (beta assessment only)
