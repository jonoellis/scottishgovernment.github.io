Use open standards and common government platforms where available.

## How point 9 improves their service

Using open standards and common government platforms means they:

* save time and money by reusing things that are already available
* can move between different technologies when they need to and don’t get locked into contracts which are difficult to end
* can quickly and easily change their service when they need to
* can give their users a more consistent experience of using government services online - this builds trust

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show:

* that they’re planning to use open standards
* they have considered common platforms the service could use and identified needs in common, if any, with any other government services

### In the alpha assessment

To pass their alpha assessment they usually need to explain:

* how they’re using open standards and common platforms to avoid getting locked into contracts
* the common platforms they’ve identified which their intended system could use
* any user needs they’ve identified that are common to other services and how they’re going to meet them in a way that’s consistent with the rest of government

### In the beta assessment

To pass their beta assessment, they usually need to explain:

* how they’re using open standards and common platforms to avoid getting locked in to contracts
* what the service outputs to users and in what format
* the common data they hold and their commitment to publishing it
* how they’re using common government platforms
* how they’re integrating with any external or legacy systems
* any common user needs their service meets and what they’re reusing from across government to help meet that user need
