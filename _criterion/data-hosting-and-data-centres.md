Adopt cloud computing or virtualisation for data hosting for the service. If not, give a strong argument for why one of the above hasn’t been used.

## How point 20 improves their service

* the adoption of cloud computing or virtualisation will reduce the cost of infrastructure – this reduces the cost of digital public services
* it will provide a reduction in Scotland’s carbon footprint through the procurement, evaluation and utilisation of data hosting and data centres with proven track records in carbon savings
* it removes the effort and complexity required to change hosting provider, to operate hybrid infrastructure (on/off premise and public/private) as well as to adjust usage based on prevailing business circumstances
* a move to virtualisation and cloud should deliver better flexibility, resilience and recoverability of the infrastructure required to power digital public services – this should lead to an increase in availability of these services for citizens

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, they’ll usually need to:

* explain current ICT data centre and hosting arrangements, if applicable
* confirm that total cost of running data centres and hosting is known, if applicable
* demonstrate consideration of cloud computing when assessing current arrangements and future investment plans
* demonstration consideration of co-location in existing data centres where cloud options not considered appropriate
* where cloud or co-location options not taken, explain reasoning for any building of new data centres

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, they’ll usually need to:

* demonstrate consideration of cloud computing when assessing current arrangements and future investment plans
* explain reasoning for shift to/not shifting to cloud
* demonstration consideration of co-location in existing data centres where cloud options not considered appropriate
* where cloud or co-location options not taken, explain reasoning for any building of new data centres

### In the beta assessment

To pass, they’ll usually need to:

* explain plans to measure and improve on data centre’s power usage effectiveness.
* demonstration consideration of co-location in existing data centres where cloud options not considered appropriate
* where cloud or co-location options not taken, explain reasoning for any building of new data centres
