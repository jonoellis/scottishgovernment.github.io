Identify and, wherever possible, remove impediments that prevent users from using the digital service, clearly establishing it as the primary channel. Plan to provide appropriate assisted digital support if necessary.

## How point 14 improves their service

Encouraging people to use their digital service allows they to:

* save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, eg call centres
* help their users to develop their digital skills
* give better assisted digital support to those who can’t use digital services on their own

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show that they:

* are aware of which channels the service is currently delivered through and the volume of transactions that go through each
* have spoken to organisations which help the users through the current services
* have considered how they will increase digital uptake

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, they usually need to talk about:

* their plan for increasing digital take-up including best practice examples
* the other channels their service is delivered through
* the data they collect on their other channels
* how they collect data on service usage for each channel
* how they have complied with data protection on any identifiable personal information
* the organisations and groups that help their user with the existing digital or non-digital services
* insights from research with real users, user demographics, attitudes, behaviors and channel preferences, and user journey maps
* how each channel meets different users’ needs
* how they’ve designed the digital service in a way that gives it clear advantages over other channels

### In the beta assessment

To pass, they usually need to:

* explain how they plan to promote and increase digital take-up , continuing into live
* the evidence behind their plans for increasing digital take-up and phasing out non-digital channels
* show weekly analytics or metrics for usage volumes across channels
* show how they’ve improved the way they communicate with users based on user insight
* discuss analytics data that shows how their new ways of communicating have performed
* usage volumes (and trends) per channel
