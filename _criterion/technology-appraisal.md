Evaluate what technology, tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service and how to procure them.

## How point 11 improves the service

Evaluating the tools and systems they use to build their service helps they to:

* check any risks or constraints associated with them
* avoid contracts that lock them in and stop them improving their service
* build a sustainable system which they can easily manage after their service goes live

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show:
* they’ve identified the building blocks needed for alpha and shown an approach for deconstructing the service into building blocks
* they can provide an indication of how the alpha product can be evolved for use in beta
* they’ve considered different technical choices and considered how they are value for money
* they’ve identified procurement approaches for alpha

### In the alpha assessment

To pass point 6 in the alpha assessment, they usually need to describe:

* the languages, frameworks and other technical choices they’ve made in alpha, and how this will affect the decisions they make in beta
* the set of programming tools they’d like to choose for beta and why
* how they’ll get value for money when buying any tools
* how they’ll monitor the status of their service

### In the beta assessment

To pass point 6 in the beta assessment they usually need to explain:

* how they’re managing the limits placed on their service by the technology stack they’ve chosen, any changes that have been made and why
* how they’re managing the limits placed on their service by the development toolchain they’ve chosen, any changes they’ve made during beta and why
* what they’ve bought, how they’re getting value for money and how they will continue to get value for money
* demonstrate how they’ll monitor the status of their service
* the support arrangements they have in place, in normal hours and out of hours
* any decisions they’ve outsourced to third parties and why they chose to do this
