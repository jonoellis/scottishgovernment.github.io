Build a service consistent with the user experience of the rest of mygov.scot, including using the mygov.scot design style guide and the GOV.UK content style guide.

## How point 13 improves their service

Using consistent language and design patterns means:

* users trust digital services because they recognise the style
* they don’t have to build something entirely new so they save time and can focus on unique parts of their service
* they’re using patterns and style which are based on data and user research

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show that they are using the mygov.scot or GDS design patterns, toolkit and style guide

### In the alpha and beta assessment

To pass their alpha and beta assessments they usually need to explain:

* how their team has included designers, content designers and front-end developers
* how the service has used the mygov.scot or GDS design patterns, front-end tool kit and style guide
* show they’ve got a start and end page on mygov.scot and that both are optimised for users

To pass the beta assessment they also need to show:

* the service is responsive and works on mobile devices
* the headers and footers match the mygov.scot style if the service is to be hosted there
