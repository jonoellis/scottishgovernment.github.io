Regularly test the end-to-end services in an environment identical to that of the live version, including on all common browsers and devices, and using dummy accounts and a representative sample of users.

## How point 21 improves the service

Testing the end-to-end service allows them to:

* find problems
* check that the service will work for the number of people who want to use it

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have a plan for testing their alpha and have identified how they’ll perform automated testing
* show that the plan for testing includes development testing and after acceptance testing for bug capture
* show that they have an approach to capturing the end user experience and taking action on feedback
* show any non-functional requirements they are planning to test during alpha

### In the alpha and beta assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have an effective deployment environment
* show that they can create new environments quickly and easily
* show that they know the data that exists in their pre-production environments
* show that they are designing and testing their service to work with the devices and browsers their users use - find out the browsers they must test with
* show that they are testing their service in an environment that’s as similar to live as possible
* show that they know that their service can keep working when the number of expected users try to use it, including for users who need assisted digital support
* show that they understand the systems they need and the testing environments for non-digital parts of the service
* show that they are testing their service frequently - they’ll have to explain how they’ve decided how often to test
