Build the service incrementally, releasing early and often, using the iterative and user-centred methods set out in the Government Digital Service Manual.

## How point 9 improves the service

Using agile methods helps them to build services that:

* meet the needs of their users
* are easy and convenient for people to use
* they can change easily, eg if government policy or technology policy changes
* they can keep improving, eg based on user feedback
* cost less and are more accountable

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have identified an approach and tools for alpha
* show that they are working in an incremental and iterative manner
* show that they have clear goals by which to measure performance
* show that they have a clear statement and plan on how the team will communicate
* show that they have identified any technical and design problems that will need to be fixed in alpha

### In the alpha and beta assessments

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* explain how they’re working in an agile way, using agile tools and techniques, and how they’ll continue to do so when the service is live
* explain how they and their team have reviewed and iterated the ways they work to fix problems
* explain how their team is using agile tools and techniques to communicate with each other
* give an example of how the team has responded to user research and usability testing
* show that their governance is agile, based on clear and measurable goals, and has a clear focus on managing change and risk in real time

They also need to discuss:

* the design options they explored for their prototype and the reasons they discarded some options
* how the design of the service has changed over time because of what they found in user research
* the design options they’re considering for their assisted digital support
* any problems that they found in research which they’ll have to solve to design the service, and how they plan to solve them
