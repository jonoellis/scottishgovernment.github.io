Define, document and regularly test a plan to handle disasters and other incidents that may cause the digital service to be taken temporarily offline.

## How point 10 improves the service

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This means they need to have a plan for what to do if their service goes offline so that they know how users will be affected and how to get it back online.

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show that they have given consideration to existing business continuity planning, including disaster recovery
* show that they have thought about any impact the service not being available will have on users
* show that they have thought about how they will assess and prioritise different incident scenarios

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* explain how users would be affected if their service was unavailable for any length of time.

### In the beta assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* explain how users of the service would be affected if the service was unavailable for any length of time and how this has changed throughout beta
* explain how they’re selecting technology and platforms that meet their availability requirements and how these will continue to do so in live
* explain their data recovery strategy and how they’ve tested it
* explain the most likely causes for the service going offline and how they plan to stop them from happening
* explain their strategy for dealing with outages, including who’s responsible and the decisions they can make
