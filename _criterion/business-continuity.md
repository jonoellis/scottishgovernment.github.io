Define, document and regularly test a plan to handle disasters and other incidents that may cause the digital service to be taken temporarily offline.

## How point 11 improves their service

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This means they need to have a plan for what to do if their service goes offline so that they know how users will be affected and how to get it back online.

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show that they:

* have given consideration to existing business continuity planning, including disaster recovery
* have thought about any impact the service not being available will have on users
* have thought about how they will assess and prioritise different incident scenarios

### In the alpha assessment

To pass the alpha assessment they need to be able to explain:

* how users would be affected if their service was unavailable for any length of time.

### In the beta assessment

To pass they usually need to explain:

* how users of the service would be affected if the service was unavailable for any length of time and how this has changed throughout beta
* how they’re selecting technology and platforms that meet their availability requirements and how these will continue to do so in live
* their data recovery strategy and how they’ve tested it
* the most likely causes for the service going offline and how they plan to stop them from happening
* their strategy for dealing with outages, including who’s responsible and the decisions they can make
