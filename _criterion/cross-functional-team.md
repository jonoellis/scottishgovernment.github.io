Put in place a sustainable multi-disciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service. This team will be led by a suitably skilled senior manager with decision-making responsibility.

## How point 7 improves the service

A multidisciplinary team helps them to:

* analyse user needs, including accessibility and assisted digital needs, and turn these into prioritised user stories
* manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams
* design, build, test and iterate software with real users, and deploy and host the software, procuring services from third parties, if needed
* support the live running of the service (accrediting and handling data, monitoring, fixing things when they break)

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* that a well-resourced team with the needed skill set is in place for alpha
* they can describe and show the resource mix is appropriate and if there are plans to bring in any skills that are missing
* that they are considering appointment of key roles for example; a service manager, product manager, delivery manager and user researcher working a sufficient number of days a week on the project on a permanent basis
* a plan for ensuring appropriate knowledge transfer to permanent staff

### In the alpha and beta assessments

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* describe their delivery team – the team should consist of roles like: service manager, product manager, delivery manager, technical architect, assisted digital lead, designer, user researcher, developer, content designer, web operations engineer, performance analyst, front-end developer
* show they have a service manager with the knowledge and power to make day-to-day decisions to improve the service
* show they have at least one user researcher working an appropriate number of days each week
* explain how the separation of key roles in the team means that nobody is performing multiple roles

They also need to:

* show they understand where gaps may emerge in the team and how to fill them
* explain their plan to transfer knowledge and skills from contractors to permanent staff
* show that there’s a person on their team who’s responsible for user research and usability tests
* show they’ll have a team that can keep improving the service after it goes live
* show the team fully understands the service after it’s gone live
* Identify how their team and their way of working will continuously improve the service once it is live
