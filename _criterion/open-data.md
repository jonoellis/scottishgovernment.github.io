Make all non-personal, non-commercially sensitive data from the service available for re-use by others under an appropriate licence.

## How point 18 improves their service

Making data open will support:

* delivery of improved public services through public bodies making use of the data;
* an opportunity to enable communities and individuals to understand more about public services, gain insight into their community and contribute to future design and delivery;
* accountability and transparency in the delivery of our public services;
* wider social and economic benefits through innovative use of the data;
* open data presents an opportunity for citizens to better engage with the public sector regarding both the development of policies and the delivery of public services;
* empowers others to use the data for new and exciting purposes;
* receiving feedback on the data we make open is valuable. Feedback and engagement can:
o	improve the quality of the data;
o	private insight into the data;
o	bring wider groups into the design of public services.
