Understand the impact of the digital service on the environment over its whole lifecycle. Plan to reduce the environmental impact of the service over time.

## How point 19 improves their service

By meeting Green ICT standards:

* ICT infrastructure will be deployed in an energy-efficient manner
* services will be delivered digitally and this will reduce our carbon footprint
* ICT operations should minimise their effect on the environment both in terms of energy usage and emissions

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass they usually need to:

* explain plans to deliver service and infrastructure in energy efficient manner
* identify relationships with other organisations to aggregate demand for services/re-use existing services
* show they have completed a baseline maturity assessment against the Scottish Government’s Green ICT maturity model and established a plan to increase Green ICT maturity
* demonstrate appropriate training has been provided to ensure that staff consider environmental implications in their day-to-day work

### In the alpha and beta assessments

To pass they usually need to:

* show plans to deliver service and infrastructure in energy efficient manner
* show relationships with other organisations to aggregate demand for services/re-use existing services
* show they have reviewed the operation of online services to increase efficiency/reduce consumption
* demonstrate improvements they have made upon existing services in conducting the procurement process in terms of Green ICT and environmental well-being for example:
  * procurement of services not assets
  * considering green credentials as important when awarding contracts
  * compare repair, refurbishment and recycling of existing systems against replacement of a system
* explain plans to dispose of equipment before it is acquired including:
  * reviewing the WEEE regulations and Scotland’s Zero Waste Plan
  * considering opportunities to sell or donate equipment
  * having a re-use and recycling policy in place
* demonstrate appropriate training has been provided to ensure that staff consider environmental implications in their day-to-day work
