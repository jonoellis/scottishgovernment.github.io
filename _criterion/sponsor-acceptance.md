Test the service from beginning to end with the minister or senior sponsor responsible for it.

## How point 22 improves the service

Ministers and/or senior sponsors are accountable for everything produced by their teams, so they need to show them their service before it goes live.

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery and alpha assessments

To pass the alpha assessment, they need to confirm that the minister and/or senior sponsor responsible for the service will test it before it goes live.

### In the beta assessment

To pass the beta assessment they need to explain how they’ll test the service with the minister and senior sponsor responsible for it from beginning to end, including any legacy or offline parts.
