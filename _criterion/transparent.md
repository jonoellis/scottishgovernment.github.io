## How point 20 improves the service

The Performance Platform collects their service’s data and presents it in a consistent, structured and easily digestible format. This helps them to:

* make quick, data-driven decisions about how to improve their service
* compare data across multiple government services
* be open and transparent to the public about their service’s performance

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show that they have spoken with the Performance Platform Team

### In the alpha assessment

To pass they usually need to show they’ve:

* registered their service with the Performance Platform
* checked that it can support the metrics they want to present on their dashboard

### In the Beta assessment

To pass they usually need to show:

* their beta dashboard with baseline data, explain their audience for beta and describe how they’ve been using the dashboard during beta, including metrics for the 4 key performance indicators (KPIs), and other metrics
* the metrics that are uploading to the Performance Platform and whether they’re being uploaded manually or automatically
* their published performance dashboard
