## How point 20 improves the service

The Performance Platform collects their service’s data and presents it in a consistent, structured and easily digestible format. This helps them to:

* make quick, data-driven decisions about how to improve their service
* compare data across multiple government services
* be open and transparent to the public about their service’s performance

## Prerequisites

To meet this standard you must collect performance data for your website, your service and your organisation. This could be achieved through a web analytics setup. For more information check out our [good practice web analytics documentation](http://scottishgovernment.github.io/guidelines/analytics/).

You must also have staff who are able to interpret performance data. This understanding will be explored during the assessment.

Finally you must report your performance publicly. This could be shown through publishing monthly data on the Performance Platform.

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to show that they have spoken with the Performance Platform Team

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show they've registered their service with the Performance Platform
* show they've checked that it can support the metrics they want to present on their dashboard

### In the Beta assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* show their beta dashboard with baseline data, explain their audience for beta and describe how they’ve been using the dashboard during beta, including metrics for the 4 key performance indicators (KPIs), and other metrics
* show the metrics that are uploading to the Performance Platform and whether they’re being uploaded manually or automatically
* show their published performance dashboard
