Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code).

## How point 8 improves their service

Making their source code open means:

* other services can reuse the software they’ve created
* other services don’t end up doing work they’ve already done and they reduce costs in government as a whole
* they avoid starting technology contracts that they can’t end easily

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions the assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass the discovery assessment, the service team usually needs to show they will make their source code open and reusable

### In the alpha assessment

To pass, they usually need to:

* explain how they plan to make all new source code open and reusable
* confirm that they own the intellectual property
* explain how someone else can reuse their code

### In the beta assessment

To pass, they usually need to:

* explain how they’re making new source code open and reusable
* show their code in an open internet source code repository
* describe how they accept contributions and comments on the code
* explain how they’re handling updates and bug fixes to the code
* explain the licences they’re using to release code during beta
* confirm that they own the intellectual property
* explain the code they’ve not made open and why
* explain how a team in another department can reuse their code
* explain how they’re using code from other teams or services
