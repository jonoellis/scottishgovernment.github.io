Build a service that can be iterated and improved on a frequent basis and make sure that you have the capability, resources and technical flexibility.

## How point 8 improves the service

They need to build a service which they can iterate and keep improving so that they can:

* easily respond to changes in policy which affect the service
* make sure their service keeps meeting user needs

## How they’ll be assessed

Their assessment and the questions assessors ask them will vary depending on their service and what it does.

### In the discovery assessment

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* an understanding of what they are planning to build in alpha
* that what is built in alpha will meet prioritised user needs identified in discovery
* understand any risks or problems associated with the technology chosen for alpha and have a plan in place for how they’ll solve them

### In the alpha and beta assessments

To pass, the service team usually need to:

* explain what they’ve built in that phase and why they built it
*	describe the lifecycle of a user story from user research to production
* show they understand how their service is built to meet user needs
* explain their process for identifying and prioritising insights from user research
* show they can move user stories quickly and smoothly between user research and production
* show they are assessing the technology they chose, minimising risk
* prove they have the ability to deploy software frequently with minimal disruption to users
* show they’re analysing user research and using it to improve their service
* show they’re solving any technical problems they’ve found

At the beta assessment, they also need to explain:

* how long they expect their service to be in beta and why
* their way of deploying software, i.e. how they can deploy frequently with minimum impact on users
* how they plan to practice zero downtime deployments in a way that doesn’t stop users using the service when in live
* how they plan to have enough staff to keep improving the service when in live
