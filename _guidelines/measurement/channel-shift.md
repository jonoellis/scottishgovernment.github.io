Channel shift, also known as digital takeup, is a long term strategic measure of how well your digital service is working. You'll monitor this on a monthly basis to track that it's on course with the desired performance levels.

## What you'll be measuring

Channel is the proportion of transactions completed online.

A digital transaction is one where the main interaction between the user and the service has been through a digital user interface. You should only classify transactions as 'digital only' if a significant part of a transaction is completed online.

## How to measure channel shift

1.    Take the number of completed digital transactions in a calendar month.
2.    Divide it by the total number of transactions in the same month, expressed as a percentage.

The total number of transactions will be made up of all non-digital transactions, including call centre transactions and paper-based transactions. Record and collect this data to make sure your digital take-up figure is accurate.

## The level of channel shift to aim for

The [Digital Landscape Research](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) found that 82% of adults in the UK are online, so it's sensible to aim for something in that region. However, about a third of those online have never accessed government information or services online, so this will involve a significant channel shift for most services.

## Services for users who are more or less than 82% online

Who's online, and how often, varies by: 

* age
* gender
* socio-economic status

Use the [Digital Landscape Research](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) as a guide. It has a useful breakdown of who's online and offline.

## Achieving your channel shift targets

Channel shift is a long-term strategic measure. Look to achieve the target level within a set time after launch.
