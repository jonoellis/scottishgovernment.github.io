#Content design

## Value of content design

The value of content design is to understand what demand the user has of a public service and find the most effective way to present that information.

At the very heart of the content design process is the concept of user needs **CHECK LINK->**(link to user needs process). Without a clear understanding what the need is, we are simply reproducing or repackaging content which already exists.

The notion of user-led is not just about delivering information and achieving a task completion. It is about understanding how those users navigate across sectors, organisations and services.

## Understanding the content landscape

User needs are the start of the content process, they provide the evidence of citizen demands. Translated into user stories, we gain a deeper understanding of the circumstances surrounding the need.
Good user needs will always be linked to a rationale for their inclusion. 

This allows a content designer to understand where the needs come from - and to form a view of how it all fits together. At this point it is not just a matter of individual pages and a site hierarchy, it is about guiding citizens through complex requirements and related public services. 

## Bringing simplicity to digital services

First and foremost content design must make information accessible and usable. That means plain English, with particular care given around the use of governmental or policy-led vocabulary.

To ensure consistency in how government services are presented to citizens, we use the Government Digital Service (GDS) editorial and style guide as the basis of our own. These standards will evolve as we work with organisations to build our knowledge of the Scottish public sector.

The remit of a content designer goes beyond creating editorial copy. Templates are not fixed where the information could be better delivered by video or an interactive format to help answer a need.

Content production is a multidisciplinary effort. Content, UX design and user research work together throughout the content lifecycle, from the initial identification of user needs to the optimisation of live content.
